# CipherByte Technologies – Data Science Internship Projects
This repository contains the tasks and projects completed during my Data Science Internship at CipherByte Technologies. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using data science techniques and tools. The work demonstrates my hands-on experience in data preprocessing, analysis, machine learning, and dashboard development.

📌 Task 1: IRIS Flower Classification (Jupyter Notebook)
🔍 Project Overview
The objective of this project was to classify Iris flower species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This is a classic supervised machine learning problem used to practice and evaluate classification models.

🧠 Key Features
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Built classification models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluated models using accuracy scores and confusion matrices

🛠 Technologies & Libraries
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

📌 Task 2: Spam Email Detection – Interactive Dashboard
🔍 Project Overview
This project involved building a desktop application that classifies emails as "Spam" or "Not Spam." The system includes an intuitive dashboard with user input, real-time prediction, and visual output.

🧠 Key Features
Text preprocessing including stemming, tokenization, and stopword removal

Visualized dataset insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Built and trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection

Developed a responsive Tkinter-based UI for prediction and result display

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python, Tkinter, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NLTK

📌 Task 3: Unemployment Analysis – Interactive Dashboard
🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing unemployment trends in India through an interactive dashboard. The system provides visual insights and forecasting using time-series techniques.

🧠 Key Features
Cleaned and organized unemployment data for analysis

Visualized trends by date and region using dynamic plots

Integrated forecasting using Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing

Built a user-friendly dashboard with dropdowns, alerts, and real-time updates

Applied custom color schemes and styles for enhanced readability

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python, Tkinter, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, PIL

🚀 Conclusion
These projects demonstrate my practical understanding of core data science concepts, including data analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, time-series forecasting, and interactive UI development. This internship provided a valuable platform to apply my skills in real-world scenarios while delivering structured, insightful solutions.
